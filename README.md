TreeHacks 2021 Submission

Inspiration
We wanted to reduce the amount of “detective” work doctors have to do before tending to patients who hospitals cannot determine their identity. Currently, medical bracelets or emergency bracelets are expensive and take a long time to produce, despite only containing a small amount of information. With QR codes, we would be able to produce them 100x faster, more than 40x cheaper, and print more information on the small amount of space contained by these bracelets.

What it does
User(friend/loved one of the patient) will input basic information about the patient and themselves. The inputted information will then output a QR code that will be worn on a bracelet. When scanned, the code will display the inputs as raw text. The generated QR code will be sent to our group, and we will print the QR code for the user (the QR code is displayed on the webpage now for clarity and simplicity.) The QR code would be printed using laser engraving on a black silicone band with a white coating. This would result in unfadeable colors, resulting in a longer durability, while reducing the production cost by printing out readable, high quality QR codes without the use of stickers, decals, and outside solvents that are normally used in printing on silicone.

How we built it
We used ASP.NET to build this application. There is no internet connection required.

Challenges we ran into
Integrating the front end with the back end. We both never used ASP.NET so there was a learning curve from going to C++ to ASPX and C#.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing the application within the allotted time. At first we were unsure of whether we had enough time to fully realize our vision. We had to simplify aspects of our original idea, but all in all we did an excellent job in learning the fundamentals of .NET development and implementing our idea in a reasonable and efficient way.

What we learned
We learned the fundamentals of .NET development, as well as how to use Microsoft LiveShare. We also learned a lot about QR codes and error correction. We are very excited about applying what we learned this weekend in our future projects.

What's next for ID-ME!
Ideally, we would implement the application on a larger scale and host it on a microsoft server. We would create a log-in interface and store patient/contact data. The QR code generated would be sent directly to production. Ideally, these bracelets would be made on-site at places such as hospitals or COVID19 testing sites so that people don’t worry about the speed or cost of delivery and they can be sold at minimal prices.

Ex: I worked on the back-end. It was my first time using Node, which was a little intimidating, but I learned a lot.
