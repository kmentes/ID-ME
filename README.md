# ID-ME
TreeHacks 2021 Submission by Evan Cheung (@Big-Cheung) and Koray Mentesoglu

Inspiration
We wanted to reduce the amount of “detective” work doctors have to do before tending to patients who hospitals cannot determine their identity. Currently, medical bracelets or emergency bracelets are expensive and take a long time to produce, despite only containing a small amount of information. With QR codes, we would be able to produce them 100x faster, more than 40x cheaper, and print more information on the small amount of space contained by these bracelets.

What it does
User(friend/loved one of the patient) will input basic information about the patient and themselves. The inputted information will then output a QR code that will be worn on a bracelet. When scanned, the code will display the inputs as raw text. The generated QR code will be sent to our group, and we will print the QR code for the user (the QR code is displayed on the webpage now for clarity and simplicity.) The QR code would be printed using laser engraving on a black silicone band with a white coating. This would result in unfadeable colors, resulting in a longer durability, while reducing the production cost by printing out readable, high quality QR codes without the use of stickers, decals, and outside solvents that are normally used in printing on silicone.

What's next for ID-ME!
Ideally, we would implement the application on a larger scale and host it on a microsoft server. We would create a log-in interface and store patient/contact data. The QR code generated would be sent directly to production. Ideally, these bracelets would be made on-site at places such as hospitals or COVID19 testing sites so that people don’t worry about the speed or cost of delivery and they can be sold at minimal prices.
